All codes should be run in r/3.5.0

## Data requirement
* HAR_coordinate.bed: Supplementary Table 1
* evolutionary gene sets (e.g. HARgene.txt): Supplementary Table 2

We used publicly available datasets that were not included in the Supplementary Table. 
* Roadmap Epigenomics: http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/data/
* phastCons: http://compgen.cshl.edu/phast/
* Disease genes: For detailed reference for each paper, check Won et al. 
  - ASD: Iossifov et al., Nature (2014); de Rubeis et al., Nature (2014)
  - Schizophrenia: Fromer et al., Nature (2014); Marshall et al., Nature Genetics (2017)
  - Developmental delay: Deciphering Developmental Disorders Study, Nature (2017)
  - Constrained genes: Kosmicki et al. Nature Genetics (2017)
  - Pathogenic missense variants: Samocha et al., bioRxiv (2017)
* Human vs. Rhesus Macaque expression difference: https://github.com/AllenBrainAtlas/DevRhesusLMD
* ExAC: http://exac.broadinstitute.org/
* Brain expression profiles: Kang et al., Nature (2011)
