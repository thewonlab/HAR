All codes should be run in r/3.5.0

## Data requirement
*HAR_coordinate.bed: Supplementary Table 1
*evolutionary gene sets (e.g. HARgene.txt): Supplementary Table 2

We used publicly available datasets that were not included in the Supplementary Table. 
*Roadmap Epigenomics: http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/data/
*phastCons: http://compgen.cshl.edu/phast/
*Disease genes: For detailed reference for each paper, check Won et al. 
- ASD: Iossifov et al., de Rubeis et al.
- Schizophrenia: Fromer et al., Marshall et al.
- Developmental delay: Deciphering Developmental Disorders Study
- Constrained genes: Kosmicki et al.
- Pathogenic missense variants: Samocha et al.
*Human vs. Rhesus Macaque expression difference: https://github.com/AllenBrainAtlas/DevRhesusLMD
